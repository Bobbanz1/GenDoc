# About The Project

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-resentment.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This tool was created as an assignment that was given to us during a python course.

DocGenerator which is inside src is the result of that assignment while the GUI was implemented later as a result of boredom combined with me wanting to see if I could make it function or not.

This file in question was written using the Tool in question!
